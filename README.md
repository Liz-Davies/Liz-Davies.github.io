## Structure
This web page was created using react. 
The react app is designed to post-load the resume.json document to allow the content to be changed and hot-swapped without having to recompile the javascript. 

## Considerations
This page is designed to be responsive and accomodating to devices of all sizes. The page is also designed with printing in mind with elements scaling and adjusting to maximize space in print so that this resumé/portfolio piece can be reused as the source for print/pdf resumés.
